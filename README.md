# Mobi Lab Components for Compose

Mobi Lab Components for Compose (`LabComponentsCompose`) help developers execute our internal design system's components on the Android platform.

Maven Central artifact available from https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=mobi.lab.labcomponents:labcomponents-compose

```groovy
implementation 'mobi.lab.labcomponents:labcomponents-compose:x.y.z' // Check the latest version from Maven Central
```

The components provide implementations for [Mobi Lab's design system](https://www.figma.com/file/gxt4iyWGyliILJSOCLXonl/P42-design-system-template?type=design&node-id=1652-14713&mode=design&t=j4TbnOpahS3korsT-0).

These components are based on [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android).

## Description

The library contains a ready-to-use Compose implementation of the components from Mobi Lab's design system. Mobi Lab's design system allows teams to focus on solving business problems instead of reinventing basic design system and UI components at the design and implementation phases.

The project consists of the component library in `lib` module and the components demo application in `app-demo` module.
